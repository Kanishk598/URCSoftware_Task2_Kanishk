## Tasks for recruitment BITS Pilani's Mars Rover Software Team for URC 2022

You can run the nodes in multiple ways:

1. Running the files individually (.py alone, .cpp alone, or combination of .py & .cpp as shown here): `rosrun Task2 increase.py`, `rosrun Task2 decrease.cpp` & `rosrun Task2 constant.py`.
2. Using launch files: `roslaunch Task2 task2_python.launch` or `roslaunch Task2 task2_cpp.launch`
